## Neural network library written in Pascal

Want to train networks in Keras/TensorFlow and run them in stand-alone programs? Then this is for you.

## Requirements
### [Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org/)

New to Pascal? Get started on Ubuntu 16.04 by issuing the following commands (you will need root user access to complete installation):
```
wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/freepascal/files/Linux/3.2.0/fpc-3.2.0-x86_64-linux.tar
tar xf fpc-3.2.0-x86_64-linux.tar
cd fpc-3.2.0-x86_64-linux
./install.sh
```
Answer `/usr/local` to whether you want to install to `/usr` or `/usr/local`.
